1) findGreatestSum
  - Given an array of positive and/or negative integers, find the greatest sum of consecutive integers. For example:
    * when given the array [2, 4, 6], findGreatestSum should return 12 as (2 + 4 + 6) is the greatest sum of consecutive integers.
    * When given the array [2, -4, 6], findGreatestSum should return 6, as 6 is greater than 2, (2 + -4), (2 + -4 + 6) and (-4 + 6).
    * When given the array [4, -2, 4], findGreatestSum should return 6, as 6 is greater than 4 and also greater than (4 + -2).
